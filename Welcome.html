<p>Welcome to my personal Dashboard !</p>

<p>My name is Anthony I have been working in the financial industry for almost 4 years. Throughout my career and my lectures I developed a real passion for data analysis and developing script. 
The main purpose of this application is to humbly demonstrate how to deploy Data Science technique on financial data. I hope that this application will inspire you like the different peoples I have been meeting during my career inspired me.

I plan to continuously improve the application so bear with me ! In his current form you can find the following :.</p>

<h4>Principal Component Analysis on USD Tresories curve</h4>

<p>The purpose is to reduce the dimentionality by exploiting the linear dependency of the yield curve. In this example we demonstrated that 
we can represent the movement in the Yield Curve with only 3 factors : level, slope, and curvature. This method can be used to monitor trade 
opportunity by evaluation if a sector of the curve has cheapened or richened.<p>

<p>For the moment the analysis can only be done on the USD Tresories collected from the FED of New York repositary. 
In the futureb I will add more data and give the user the possibility to load his own data.</p>
